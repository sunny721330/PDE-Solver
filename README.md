# PDE-Solver
Solve High Dimensional PDE using BSDE and Deep Neural Network. The PDE to be solved could be Allen-Cahn equation, HJB equation, Derivative Pricing PDE and Burger-type PDE. Run BSDE.py using commandline, specify the argument --equation=PDE where PDE could take value 'Allen-Cahn', 'HJB', 'Pricing' or 'Burger'. This replicate result in section 4 of the paper 'Deep learning-based numerical methods for high-dimentsional parabolic partial differential equations and backward stochastic differential equation' by E, Han and Jentzen.
